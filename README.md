# WeBoss
Secret Project for the end of the year


We had to make a project related to autonomous car.
We decided to create a van, in order to make coworking (and working) easier.


In order to interact with this van, you have an application (made for mobile): http://app-weboss.tk/ 


Then when you're IN the van, there's a table, and a board. You can interact with them, the interface is here (made for devices with interface like PCs): http://table-weboss.tk/
